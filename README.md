# 🌕 Where is the Moon? AR

The iOS paid app `Moon Shape Pro` allows users to intuitively check the real-time position of the moon using the iPhone camera. Building on the features of the free app `Moon Shape Widget`, we have enhanced the capabilities significantly and released `Moon Shape Pro` as a premium version. As a special offering, we have made one of the key features, the **AR function**, publicly available so that anyone can experience the position of the moon through augmented reality.
